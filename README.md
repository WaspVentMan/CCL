# CCL
Custom command line, uses no imports other than OS. Only rem_convert uses an extra import (PIL) due to it getting image data and idk how to do that (yet)
# Remage
The thing you are probably here for! Remage is the (work in progress) terminal based image format I have been creating for the past few months.

The `.remage` file format is still a work in progress, so errors are to be expected.

(decription/documentation) <--- add this later :trollface:
