# Remage
The thing you are probably here for! Remage is the (work in progress) terminal based image format I have been creating for the past few months.

The `.remage` file format is still a work in progress, so [errors](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/823269502946115594/951150053177827328/unknown.png) are to be expected. The format is also being updated, so some versions of images may not be compatable with newer or older versions.

### How does it work?
The remage format uses funny compression with a hint of brain damage to make images
